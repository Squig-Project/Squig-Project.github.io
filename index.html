    <h3>About</h3>

    <p>
        The Squig Project is an open source memory tool, used to view the remote memory of a windows process. <br> 
        If you are a low level expert, or a user who just wants to view the memory of a running process, Squig is easy to pick up. <br>
        Squig uses a win32 named pipe to take inputs from the user and pass it to the server, the user connects via the client process. <br>
        Squig is written in ANSI C/C++ and shouldn't be used for professional work, Squig is a hobbyist based project. <br>
        Squig is fast, performant and open source, which means it's nicer to use and open for everyone to contribute, which by the way helps a lot. <br>
